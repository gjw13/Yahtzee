# Yahtzee
Yahtzee board game implemented with Java GUI

This program is intended to implement the Yahtzee board game with Java Graphical User Interface.

It is set up with 5 die in the middle and two panels on the side to track scores. Next to each score is a button to be
pressed after a roll is completed. The button will only be active if the roll indicates this score is a possibility and hasn't
been selected before in the current game.
